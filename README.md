# Webpack Project by: Mohamed Magdy

This is the final project to analyze a news article.

## Get Up and Running

- ```npm install```
- ```npm start``` to start the app
- this app runs on localhost:8080, but you can of course edit that in index.js.

## Disclaimer

this project is based on the provided repo for the course practice and i used the documentations for webpack to get some of the codes.
